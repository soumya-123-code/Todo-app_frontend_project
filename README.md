## Overview

### The Challenge

Manage your tasks efficiently with our interactive Todo List app! 

This user-friendly frontend application allows users to:
- View an optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for interactive elements.
- Perform actions such as adding new todos, marking them as complete, deleting them, filtering by status (all/active/complete), clearing completed todos, and toggling between light and dark mode.
- Drag and drop to reorder items on the list.

### How to Setup the Project

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using GitHub Desktop or Git Bash:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/soumya-123-code/Todo-app_frontend_project.git
    ```
2. Open the project folder in your code editor.
3. Run the project using a live server extension or deploy it using Netlify, Vercel, or another web hosting service.

## My Process

### Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

All required assets are in the `/design` folder. The `style-guide.md` file contains details such as color palette and fonts.

### What I Learned

This project enhanced my understanding of implementing CRUD operations in web applications. The logic can be adapted to any tech stack. Here's an example:

```js
function removeTodo(e) {
  if (e.target.nodeName !== "IMG") return;
  const removedItem = e.target.parentNode.previousElementSibling.children[2].textContent;
  todoArray = todoArray.filter((todo) => todo.todoItem !== removedItem);

  if (window.confirm(`Are you sure you want to delete: ${removedItem}`)) {
    e.target.parentNode.parentNode.remove();
    handleEmptyMessage();
    getTodoCount();
  } else return;
  saveToLocalStorage(todoArray);
}
```

### Continued Development

This project highlighted areas where I can improve:
- Mastering CSS Flexbox and Grid for layout structuring.
- Deepening my understanding of `fetch` and `async/await` in JavaScript.
- Implementing state management for larger applications.

By focusing on these areas, I aim to enhance my skills and become a better full-stack developer.
